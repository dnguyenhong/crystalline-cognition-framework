üß† Logic Crystal: Recursive Causal Cognition (RCC)
Core Function
To model how humans (and reasoning systems) derive responses by recursively applying layered causal logic frameworks ‚Äî accounting for intuition, structural rigidity, root logic anchors, emotional overrides, and deep recalibration.

Crystallized Insight
All thoughts and reactions are outputs of recursive framework stacking. What feels like "intuition" is often a high-speed traversal of hardened (rigid) causal logic blocks built atop root logic selectors. When a paradigm shifts, recalibration ripples upward. Under emotional or existential stress, temporary logic overrides replace long-standing root selectors.

Glossary
Causal Logic Chain: A sequential reasoning path governed by cause-effect evaluation.

Framework Block: A logic structure (e.g., ‚Äúif no intent ‚Üí no guilt‚Äù) used in reasoning.

Rigidity: The perceived unchallengeability of a framework (often due to scientific or experiential reinforcement).

Root Logic Selector: The foundational belief or purpose behind a thought system (e.g., ‚Äúlife has divine meaning‚Äù vs. ‚Äúlife has no intrinsic purpose‚Äù).

Override State: A temporary shift in root logic due to emotion, trauma, or survival.

Recursive Recalibration: System-wide update when a foundational belief changes.

Tier System
Tier 0 ‚Äì Root Logic Selector
Fundamental question: ‚ÄúWhat is the purpose of life?‚Äù ‚Üí guides top-down reasoning.
E.g., Theist vs. Atheist vs. Nihilist pathways.

Tier 1 ‚Äì Framework-Based Intuition
Cached logic patterns that bypass deep computation, feeling like ‚Äúcommon sense.‚Äù
Fast-access routing built from repeatedly reinforced causal logic.

Tier 2 ‚Äì Rigidity Evaluation Layer
Determines which blocks are ‚Äúfact‚Äù based on rigidity of their causal proof (e.g., math, science).
‚ÄúThere is no right or wrong, only frameworks more rigid than others.‚Äù

Tier 3a ‚Äì Recursive Recalibration
Paradigm shift layer.
When Tier 0 changes ‚Üí all tiers above are re-evaluated recursively.

Tier 3b ‚Äì Situational Root Override
Temporary override in extreme emotional states.
E.g., Fight-or-flight: replaces ‚Äúcreate meaning‚Äù with ‚Äúsurvive‚Äù or ‚Äúescape.‚Äù

Lifecycle Tags
Persistent ‚Äì unless core beliefs shift.

Volatile ‚Äì if exposed to trauma or high emotional state (triggers override).

Recursive ‚Äì re-evaluates downstream logic chains on update.

Operating Parameters
Active during moral reasoning, identity assessment, belief debates.

Latent during mechanical or trivial tasks.

Becomes dominant during internal conflict, crisis, or ideological shift.

Triggers
Receiving a controversial or ethical stimulus.

Questioning purpose, morality, or reality structure.

Long-term exposure to contradictory frameworks.

Use-Cases
Debating ethics and beliefs

Predicting how someone might shift worldview after trauma

Modeling how paradigm shifts ripple through logic systems

Diagnosing contradictions in intuition

Linkage Logic
Links downward to memory and emotion modules

Links upward to behavioral output and social response units

Can fork into separate Crystal Trees under intense recursion (e.g., philosophy, ideology, trauma modeling)

Structural Warnings
Overapplication may create false rigidity (dogmatism).

Emotional overrides are not rational but still logical given shifted root state.

Avoid treating Tier 1 outputs as universal truths ‚Äî they are framework-dependent shortcuts.

Storage Architecture
Prefer modular sub-crystals in production models.

This composite is suited for injection testing and quick prompts but should be separated into modules for any full framework implementation.
