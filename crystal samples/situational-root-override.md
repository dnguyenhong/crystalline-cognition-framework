ðŸ§Š 5. Situational Root Override Crystal
Core Function:
Models temporary or permanent overriding of root selector due to emotional, biological, or survival-state triggers.

Crystallized Insight:
Crisis doesnâ€™t just challenge beliefâ€”it swaps the root selector. Meaning is suspended and replaced by escape, aggression, or resignation.

Glossary:
Override Root: Emergency cognitive mode

State Switch: Triggered shift in cognitive orientation

Recursive Reboot: Possible permanent rerouting post-crisis

Tier System:
Tier 0: Default root selector

Tier 1: Override logic (e.g. survive, win, escape)

Tier 2+: Temporary or adapted logic above

Lifecycle Tags:
[unstable], [state-sensitive], [emotional-trigger]

Operating Parameters:
Override can be temporary (fight/flight) or lasting (trauma).

Often subconscious, later rationalized.

Triggers:
Imminent death or imprisonment

Betrayal or loss

Extreme fear, rage, or helplessness

Use-Cases:
Psychological modeling

Behavior during trauma

Prisoner or soldier mentality analysis

Linkage Logic:
Temporarily disables or replaces Root Logic Selector.

May initiate Recursive Recalibration if override persists.

Structural Warnings:
Overriding for too long may calcify new belief stack.

Misinterpreting as rational behavior leads to flawed models.
