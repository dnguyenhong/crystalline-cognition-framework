üßä 1. Framework-Based Intuition Crystal
Core Function:
Models how human intuition emerges from cached reasoning built on previously established logic blocks, rather than spontaneous unstructured thought.

Crystallized Insight:
Intuition is not irrational‚Äîit is fast-path reasoning through rigid framework clusters stored from past logic processing.

Glossary:
Intuition: Compressed logic that bypasses recalculation.

Logic Blocks: Modular units of reasoning.

Framework Stack: Layered causal pathways that shape perception.

Tier System:
Tier 1: Basic perception filters.

Tier 2: Stored logic units (ethical, social, epistemic).

Tier 3: Intuition as expression of highest-rigidity pathways.

Lifecycle Tags:
[mature], [stable-cache], [fast-path-access]

Operating Parameters:
Applies to routine judgments or social responses.

Fails in novel situations unless framework is updated.

Triggers:
Fast moral responses

‚ÄúGut feeling‚Äù vs overthinking

Use-Cases:
Cognitive modeling

Explaining moral reflexes

Argumentation strategy

Linkage Logic:
Feeds into Root Logic Selector and Rigidity-as-Truth.

Shares recursion path with Situational Override under stress.

Structural Warnings:
May lead to overconfidence if outdated logic blocks persist unchallenged.
