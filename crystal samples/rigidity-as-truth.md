üßä 2. Rigidity-as-Truth Crystal
Core Function:
Reframes ‚Äútruth‚Äù not as absolute but as a measure of how structurally rigid and consistent a logic chain is across time and context.

Crystallized Insight:
Truth is the rigidity of a logic structure under recursive stress. ‚ÄúWrong‚Äù is fragility exposed.

Glossary:
Rigidity: Resistance to collapse under scrutiny.

Causal Logic Chain: Sequential reasoning pathway.

Stress Test: Challenges to internal coherence or external prediction.

Tier System:
Tier 1: Belief vs perception distinction.

Tier 2: Logic consistency and predictive accuracy.

Tier 3: Recursive survivability across frameworks.

Lifecycle Tags:
[stress-resistant], [used-in-debate], [evaluative]

Operating Parameters:
Does not assume metaphysical truth.

Uses internal and cross-framework integrity as test.

Triggers:
Philosophical debate

Legal reasoning

Scientific model evaluation

Use-Cases:
Argument strength assessment

Framework comparison

Rhetoric training

Linkage Logic:
Supports Recalibration and Root Selector Crystals.

Measures intuition validity from Crystal 1.

Structural Warnings:
Rigid ‚â† right in all contexts (e.g., socially destructive ideologies can be internally rigid).
