üßä 4. Root Logic Selector Crystal
Core Function:
Determines the foundational question that orients all cognitive and moral logic above it. Usually implicit.

Crystallized Insight:
The answer to ‚ÄúWhat is the meaning of life?‚Äù serves as a cognitive root selector. Everything else grows upward from that axis.

Glossary:
Root Selector: Primary orienting belief.

Cognitive Axis: Guiding principle shaping all decisions.

Recursive Builder: Chain of logic stemming from one root.

Tier System:
Tier 0: Ontological commitment (e.g., God exists / not)

Tier 1: Meaning and identity

Tier 2+: Ethics, purpose, social models

Lifecycle Tags:
[foundational], [identity-core], [recursive-driver]

Operating Parameters:
Assumed unconsciously by most.

Difficult to override without existential trigger.

Triggers:
Existential crisis

Cultural immersion

Philosophical introspection

Use-Cases:
Worldview profiling

Belief conflict analysis

Cross-ideology communication

Linkage Logic:
Root of all other Crystals.

Overrides cause Recursive Recalibration.

Structural Warnings:
Different root selectors = incommensurable logic stacks.

Changing root may cause total cognitive disorientation.
