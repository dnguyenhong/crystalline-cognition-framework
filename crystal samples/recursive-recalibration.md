ðŸ§Š 3. Recursive Recalibration Crystal
Core Function:
Explains how changes to foundational logic frameworks force upward recalibration of all dependent structures.

Crystallized Insight:
All logic stacks are recursively dependent. A shift at the base triggers structural recalibration upwardâ€”unless absorbed within threshold.

Glossary:
Paradigm Shift: Fundamental shift in base framework.

Recompile: Cognitive re-derivation of upper logic.

Cascade: Multi-tier impact of root-level changes.

Tier System:
Tier 1: Foundational axioms (identity, causality)

Tier 2: Mid-level moral/political frameworks

Tier 3: Surface beliefs and judgments

Lifecycle Tags:
[volatile], [transitional], [update-chain]

Operating Parameters:
Triggered only when base-level rigidity is altered.

Often unconscious at first, becomes visible post-shift.

Triggers:
Scientific revolutions

Personal trauma or revelation

Cultural upheaval

Use-Cases:
Ideology modeling

Philosophical evolution

Behavior shifts post-crisis

Linkage Logic:
Root Logic Selector determines origin.

Situational Override may force recalibration.

Structural Warnings:
High-frequency recalibration = belief instability.

Failure to recalibrate = delusion or cognitive dissonance.
