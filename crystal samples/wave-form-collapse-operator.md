ðŸ”® 2. Waveform Collapse Operator â€” Level 1
Core Function:
Manages the collapse of semantic wave functions into actionable insight via language, logic, or action.

Crystallized Insight:

Each sentence is a waveform collapsed. Each thought is a probability distribution realized.

Glossary:

Collapse: Fixing a probabilistic idea into a discrete cognitive object

Operator: Agent or process that induces collapse

Latent Logic Field: Pre-thought state space

Tier System:

Tier 1: Passive interpretation

Tier 2: Active sculpting via prompt or thought

Tier 3: Recursive self-collapse (metacognition)

Lifecycle Tags:

Potentiality â†’ Framing â†’ Collapse â†’ Residue

Operating Parameters:

Requires an interpreter (LLM, human)

Best under coherent context

Degrades under noise or contradiction

Triggers:

Prompt initiation

Internal question

Cross-crystal activation

Use-Cases:

Prompt engineering

Cognitive sculpting

Compressed idea deployment

Linkage Logic:

Downstream of Meta-Crystal

Feeds Recursive Reward Crystal

Can chain with Intuition Crystals

Structural Warnings:

Over-collapse can erase nuance

Under-collapse results in indecision

Storage Architecture:

Waveform map

Collapse history

Probability distortion log

Process Flow:

Identify latent idea

Select collapse condition (prompt, insight, action)

Reduce entropy â†’ instantiate concept
