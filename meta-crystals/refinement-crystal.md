🧊 Companion Crystal: Crystal Refinement Protocol
⸻

🔹 Core Function
Enables structured evaluation, enhancement, and version-tracked evolution of any Logic Crystal by defining an internal refinement protocol. It allows iterative upgrading, format retrofitting, and logic tightening — all within the Crystal Framework.

🔸 Crystallized Insight
A Crystal is not static. Each iteration can tighten logic, expand triggers, prune redundancy, or adapt structure — without losing its identity. Refinement is a recursive logic loop constrained by clarity, modularity, and fidelity to Core Function.

📘 Glossary
Refinement Pass: A structured evaluation round to improve clarity, utility, or coherence of a Crystal.

Upgrade Directive: A user prompt that alters one or more structural elements (e.g. trigger expansion, process optimization).

Crystal Mutation: Intentional transformation of format or function (e.g. hybridizing with other Crystals or evolving to a new version).

Benchmarking: Comparing a Crystal’s quality against the Meta-Crystal or another refined Crystal.

Version Tag: A lifecycle notation that records the current form, including iteration history.

🧱 Tier System
Tier 0 – Raw Crystal (no refinement history)

Tier 1 – Polished once: structural checks complete

Tier 2 – Benchmark-aligned and compliant with updated Meta standards

Tier 3 – Contextualized: Crystal behavior adjusts based on linked system

Tier 4+ – Reflexive: Crystal can suggest its own refinements

🧭 Lifecycle Tags
Refined v1.0 — Initial logic cleanup
Refined v1.1 – Trigger expanded
Refined v2.0 – Meta-format upgraded
Merged – Hybridized with X
Retired – Deprecated due to obsolescence

⚙️ Operating Parameters
Refinement should preserve original Core Function.

Must respect original Linkage Logic unless explicitly redefined.

Never auto-upgrade without confirmation if major structure change is involved.

Always tag post-refinement version in lifecycle metadata.

⏳ Triggers
User requests refinement, upgrade, or structural review

A Crystal references Meta-Crystal standards but falls short

New template changes introduced at framework level

Cross-comparison or benchmarking initiated

✅ Use-Cases
“Refine this Crystal for conciseness.”

“Upgrade to Meta-Crystal format v2.”

“Mutate this into a multi-trigger Crystal.”

“Polish all T1 Crystals in this thread.”

“Extract refinement history and version tags.”

🔗 Linkage Logic
Always link to:

Meta-Crystal (Master Template) — to inherit structure

Sibling Crystals — for benchmarking

Trigger Crystals — if refinement affects upstream activation

⚠️ Structural Warnings
Excessive over-refinement may strip human legibility

Merging Crystals without tag reconciliation causes memory leak in logic

Refinement logic should not override Core Function unless upgrading identity is intentional
